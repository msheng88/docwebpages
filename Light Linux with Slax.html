<h1>Light Linux with Slax</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.slax.org/">Slax</a> is a very light, multilingual Linux 
distribution based on Slackware. This article is based on release 7.0.5.</p>
<h2>Information</h2>
<p>Persistent changes are no longer made in /slax/changes/ but rather /live/memory/changes</p>
<p>Slax modules/bundles are rebuilt Slackware packages</p>
<p>If you need to save a file onto the USB keydrive while running Slax, save 
it in /mnt/live/memory/.</p>
<h2>Temp Things to do</h2>
<h3><strike>Install Slax on hard drive</strike></h3>
<h4>Linux</h4>
<p>We'll assume the hard drive is empty, so there's no need to multiboot to 
Windows:</p>
<ol type="1">
    <li>Boot Slax from a USB keydrive</li>
    <li>Create and format a Linux partition on the hard drive (eg. mkfs.ext4 
    /dev/sda1; &quot;... is not a block special device.&quot; means the partition 
    should be unmounted before formatting)</li>
    <li>From the Slax site, download the ZIP file, and unzip into the partition 
    (eg. wget -c <a href="http://www.slax.org/download/7.0.5/slax-French-7.0.5-i486.zip;">http://www.slax.org/download/7.0.5/slax-French-7.0.5-i486.zip;</a> 
    cd /mnt/sda1 ; unzip slax-French-7.0.5-i486.zip)</li>
    <li>Cd to /slax/boot, and run bootinst.bat (not bootinst.sh?), which will 
    install Grub in the MBR</li>
    <li>Reboot while removing the USB keydrive</li>
</ol>
<h4>Windows</h4>
<p>Slax doesn't require a Linux partition. The contents of its ZIP file can 
be unzipped in an NTFS partition. grub4dos will take care of booting up Slax 
without making changes to the MBR.</p>

<h3><strike>Kitty: Change colors for man pages</strike></h3>
<h3><strike>Error installing Chrome through Software Center</strike></h3>
<p>Booted from USB keydrive &gt; Software Center.</p>
<p>&quot;Error mounting of the bundle, perhaps corrupted download&quot;</p>
<p>Tried again: &quot;Slax bundle is already active as 2230-chrome.sb&quot;. 
Rebooted, &quot;Slax bundle is already active as 2230-chrome.sb&quot; but found 
in KDE Internet menu.</p>
<h3><strike>Switch between FR and US-EN interface</strike></h3>
<p>&quot;US English&quot; is included in all releases of Slax, even if you installed 
a different release. Go into KDE's System Configuration &gt; Localization, click 
on the Languages tab, add US-EN to &quot;Prefered Languages&quot;, and reboot.</p>
<h3><strike>How to remove a module (eg. Firefox) entirely?</strike></h3>
<p>The orthodox way is to run &quot;slax info&quot;, followed by &quot;slax 
deactivate &lt;module&gt;&quot;. If it fails because the app has some process 
running, just remove the .sb file located under /mnt/live/memory/data/slax/, 
and reboot.</p>
<p>Before removing Firefox, be aware that Software Center relies on it...</p>
<h3><strike>Load all mass storage devices (HD partitions + external drives)</strike></h3>
<p>Just add a script in /etc/rc.d/rc3.d/:</p>
<dl>
    <dd>#!/bin/bash
    <dd>/usr/libexec/udisks-daemon &amp;
    <dd>/usr/libexec/polkitd &amp;

<p>&quot;udisks provides an interface to enumerate storage devices and perform

and the kernel.&quot;</p>

DeviceKit-disks) is a replacement for part of the functionality which used be

<p>&quot;The udisks daemon serves as an interface to system block devices, implemented 
via D-Bus. It handles operations such as querying, mounting, unmounting, formatting, 
or detaching storage devices such as hard disks or USB thumb drives.<br>This 
package also provides the udisks utility, which can be used to trigger these 
operations from the command line (if permitted by PolicyKit). External tools 
such as hdparm are used if available to implement extra operations, such as 
configuring disk spindown times.&quot;</p>

(from markds)</p>
<p>&quot;By default, Slax detects if you run it from a writable device. If yes, 
then all the changes you make to the operating system itself are saved and restored 
next time you boot. If your device uses FAT filesystem, which is most common 
on USB flash drives, then all file modifications to Slax itself are saved into 
a special file changes.dat, which is created on your boot device in /slax/changes/ 
directory, and grows automatically in size up to 4GB. If your boot device uses 
a native Linux filesystem such as ext4, then the changed files are saved natively 
to /slax/changes/ directory without any need for intermediate changes.dat file. 
If you, for any reason, do not like persistent changes, simply uncheck the appropriate 
boot option and your Slax will start using the default 'fresh' configuration 
and won't save any modifications. It may be useful also in cases you'd like 
to test something system-wide, since you can always revert to the default state 
by simple reboot (in case things screw up).</p>
<p>The file changes.dat is designed to work even on FAT filesystems, which are 
commonly used on most USB flash drives. Unfortunately FAT is limited to 4GB 
file size; for that reason, persistent changes can't grow more. In case you 
need to save more, please format your storage drive with some Linux filesystem 
such as EXT4 or BTRFS and install Slax to it. Slax will be able to save changes 
natively and will be limited only by the actual capacity of your device. Persistent 
Changes functionality does not (of course) affect files on hard drives in your 
computer. If you modify these files, they will always be modified regardless 
of your persistent changes settings.</p>
<p>The empty directory /memory/changes is writable, thus the entire AUFS mount 
in /memory/union happens to be writable as well. All new or changed files inside 
the union are copied-up to this empty directory before the system creates or 
modifies them. Since the directory for changes resides on tmpfs (that is in 
RAM), all new and modified files are stored in RAM and thus are lost on reboot.</p>
<p>Yet if Slax is started from a writable media such as USB device or hard disk, 
it recognizes that and mounts the writable drive over /memory/changes before 
it is joined with the other branches in union, which effectively means that 
changed and new files will be stored on the boot device rather than in RAM, 
and reboot won't erase them. This feature is called Persistent Changes and can 
be turned on or off by a boot menu setting. &quot; <a href="http://www.slax.org/en/documentation.php">http://www.slax.org/en/documentation.php</a></p>
<h3>Remove unneeded options in boot menu?</h3>
<p>Boot menu: From boot menu, remove all options (Persistent changes, Graphical 
desktop, Copy to RAM, Act as PXE server) and replace with two options: &quot;Start 
Slax&quot; and &quot;Run diagnostic&quot; (to run either lshw or dmidecode and 
e-mail output)</p>
<h3>Add option to boot into text mode and run lshw/lspci/dmidecode</h3>
<p>Edit /slax/boot/syslinux.cfg</p>
<p>Also check /syslinux.cfg</p>

<p>You can use an unused runlevel for that, for example runlevel 4 on non-Slackware 
systems or runlevel 5 on Slackware systems.</p>
<p>After you have configured a runlevel to behave in the way you want just change 
the option in the bootloader to boot into that specific runlevel.</p>

<p>Run the Software Center. If the icon was removed from the desktop, /usr/bin/softcenter.</p>
<h3>What is &quot;slax activate&quot;?</h3>
<p>Activating = installing.</p>
<p>Per <a href="http://www.slax.org/en/documentation.php#modules">Slax modules</a>: 
&quot;Slax modules do not need unpacking. They are used in the packed form. 
Instead of installing, Slax modules are activated. In technical terms, that 
means mounted and added to aufs union as a new branch.</p>
<p>[...] Offline module activation is performed when Slax is not running. You 
can activate module (a file with .sb extension) by copying it to /slax/modules/ 
directory on your boot device. All modules copied there will be automatically 
activated during Slax startup. Removing the module (the file with .sb extension) 
from /slax/modules/ directory will uninstall it so it is not a part of Slax 
any longer.</p>
<p>Online module activation is performed when Slax is running, directly within 
Slax system. You can either use Software Center to activate and deactivate modules 
on the fly or you can use [command-line] commands&quot; (slax search/info/download/activate.)</p>
<h3>How to install an application not available as a Slax bundle?</h3>
<p>If it's available&nbsp;as a Slackware package, open a console to convert 
it to a Slax bundle with &quot;txz2sb&quot;, put the resulting .sb file into 
slax/modules, and reboot.</p>
